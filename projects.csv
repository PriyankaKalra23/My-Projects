The cause of postpartum depression is not known and many new mothers donÂ’t recognize the symptoms, so they fail to get the treatment they need. At the University of Ottawa Dr. Ri-hua Xie is working to develop social support strategies to help prevent the illness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But Ontarians, who have one of the highest rates of colorectal cancer in the world  , may soon have an important new weapon in the fight against the disease, thanks to research being conducted at the University of Toronto and Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR).

The duct is then filled with grout to protect the steel.  The steel under tension puts the concrete in compression and, thereby, increases its resistance to cracking.  This allows structures to be built which are thinner, longer, and stronger than conventionally reinforced structures and so reduces the amount of concrete and steel used.  However, monitoring the condition of the steel strands once they are in place is a big challenge Â– one being tackled by Dr. Shahzma Jaffer at the University of Waterloo.
